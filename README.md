##  Project Overview

**Noteify** is a clean, responsive, and interactive **full-stack web application** designed to help users create, manage, search, edit, and delete notes effortlessly.

Originally built in **two learning phases**:

* **Phase 1:** Static UI with **HTML + CSS**
* **Phase 2:** Dynamic interactivity with **JavaScript**

It now evolves into a **professional full-stack version**, where the polished frontend is connected to a **PHP backend** and **MySQL database** for persistent, scalable, and real-world data handling.

> Noteify is not just a classroom project — it is a portfolio-ready web application that demonstrates the progression from frontend fundamentals to backend integration and full-stack development.

---

##  Key Highlights

*  Create, edit, and delete notes in real time
*  Instant note search and filtering
*  Elegant dark mode for accessibility and comfort
*  Persistent storage using **LocalStorage** (Phase 1 & 2)
*  Full-stack data persistence using **PHP + MySQL** (Professional version)
*  Fully responsive design for desktop, tablet, and mobile
*  Fast and lightweight UI with modern minimal design
*  Future-ready architecture for **calendar integration and real notifications**

---

##  Project Purpose

The goal of **Noteify** is to demonstrate how a simple browser-based note app can grow into a complete production-style web system.

This project showcases:

* Frontend structure and styling
* Responsive web design
* JavaScript DOM manipulation and CRUD logic
* Local browser persistence using `localStorage`
* Backend API handling with PHP
* Database-driven note management with MySQL
* Scalable architecture for future features like reminders and notifications

It is ideal for:

*  Students learning web development
*  Portfolio presentation
*  Practice for CRUD-based applications
*  Beginner full-stack projects

---

#  System Architecture

## Frontend Layer

The frontend focuses on user experience, responsiveness, and modern design principles.

### Built With

* **HTML5** — semantic page structure
* **CSS3** — modern styling using Flexbox, Grid, animations, and dark mode
* **JavaScript (ES6)** — interactive behavior and dynamic CRUD operations

### Frontend Responsibilities

* Render the note interface
* Capture user input
* Handle search, edit, delete, and add actions
* Provide instant visual feedback
* Toggle dark/light theme
* Communicate with backend APIs using `fetch()`

---

## Backend Layer

The backend powers the professional version of Noteify using **PHP**.

### Built With

* **PHP 8+** — server-side logic
* **MySQL / MariaDB** — relational database storage
* **REST-style API endpoints** — for CRUD operations

### Backend Responsibilities

* Receive note requests from frontend
* Validate input data
* Store notes in database
* Update and delete records securely
* Return JSON responses to the client
* Enable future features such as:

  * user authentication
  * scheduled reminders
  * notification triggers
  * calendar event syncing

---

#  Project Synopsis

**Noteify** is designed as a lightweight productivity app with a strong learning foundation and a professional upgrade path.

The original version works **offline in the browser** using `localStorage`, making it simple and beginner-friendly.

The enhanced full-stack version introduces:

* Persistent server-side storage
* Structured backend endpoints
* Real database integration
* Better scalability for multiple users
* Foundation for advanced features like reminders and calendar-based alerts

This makes **Noteify** an excellent example of transitioning from:

**Static Design → Dynamic Frontend → Full-Stack Application**

---

#  Implemented Solution

## Phase 1 & 2 (Frontend + LocalStorage)

The initial implementation focuses on a fast, offline-friendly browser experience:

* Notes stored in **LocalStorage**
* CRUD operations handled via **JavaScript DOM manipulation**
* Search filtering in real time
* Responsive layout using **Flexbox** and **CSS Grid**
* Dark mode toggle for accessibility
* Minimal, modern UI/UX

## Professional Full-Stack Version (Frontend + PHP Backend)

The upgraded solution extends Noteify into a real-world web app:

* Frontend remains lightweight and responsive
* Notes are stored in **MySQL** instead of only LocalStorage
* JavaScript uses **Fetch API / AJAX** to communicate with PHP
* Backend exposes endpoints for:

  * Create Note
  * Read Notes
  * Update Note
  * Delete Note
* Data validation and sanitization on server side
* JSON responses for clean frontend integration

* **Git** installed (optional)
* A local PHP server such as:

  * **XAMPP**
  * **Laragon**
  * **WAMP**
* **MySQL / MariaDB** installed and running

---

#  Installation Guide

## 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Maxd646/noteify.git
cd noteify
```

## 2. Frontend-Only Version (Learning Version)

Simply open:

```bash
index.html
```

in your browser.

This version works using **LocalStorage** only.

---

## 3. Full-Stack PHP Version Setup

### Step 1: Move Project to Local Server

Place the project inside your local server directory.

**Example (XAMPP):**

```bash
C:/xampp/htdocs/noteify/
```

### Step 2: Create Database

Open **phpMyAdmin** and create a database named:

```sql
noteify_db
```

### Step 3: Import SQL Schema

Use the SQL file from:

```bash
backend/sql/noteify.sql
```

Example schema:

```sql
CREATE DATABASE IF NOT EXISTS noteify_db;
USE noteify_db;

CREATE TABLE notes (
    id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    title VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    content TEXT NOT NULL,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    updated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP ON UPDATE CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);
```

### Step 4: Configure Database Connection

Edit:

```bash
backend/config/db.php
```

Example:

```php
<?php
$host = "localhost";
$dbname = "noteify_db";
$username = "root";
$password = "";

$conn = new mysqli($host, $username, $password, $dbname);

if ($conn->connect_error) {
    die("Database connection failed: " . $conn->connect_error);
}
?>
```

### Step 5: Start Apache + MySQL

Start services from **XAMPP / Laragon / WAMP**.

### Step 6: Open in Browser

```bash
http://localhost/noteify/
```
